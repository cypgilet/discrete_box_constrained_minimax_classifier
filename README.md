# Discrete Box-Constrained Minimax Classifier for Uncertain and Imbalanced Class Proportions

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful.

We provide here a Matlab folder containing two differents subfolders:

+ The first one (named "Toy Example") provides an example of how to use our box-constrained minimax classifier algorithm for any classification tasks.
+ The second one (named "Paper Experiments") provides the script used to obtain the results in our paper "Discrete Box-Constrained Minimax Classifier for Uncertain and Imbalanced Class Proportions".

We will also try to provide a Python version of our method as soon as possible.
